    <P>All implicit parameters are passed by reference. If they are
      conceptually passed by value, then the <TT>const</TT> keyword needs to be
      used in the member function definition. By default explicit parameters are
      passed by value. The <TT>&amp;</TT> symbol needs to be supplied to the
      explicit parameters if they are to be passed by reference. </P>
