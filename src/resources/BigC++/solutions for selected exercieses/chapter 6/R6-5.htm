    <P>An accessor function that is missing a <TT>const</TT> keyword in its
      definition will still work as expected. However, there will be compiler
      errors if another member function that has been properly declared as <TT>const</TT>
      makes use of this function.</P>
    
    <P>If you accidentally supply the <TT>const</TT> keywork in a mutator
      function, then a compile-time error will occur when the function attempts
      to modify the object's data.</P>
