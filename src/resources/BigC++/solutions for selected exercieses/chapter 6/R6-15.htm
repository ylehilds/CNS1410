    <P>No, not every data field needs an accessor. For example, the <TT>istream</TT>
      class has a number of data fields that make input possible. You don't need
      to know about them in order to read input. Therefore, you don't need an
      accessor.</P>
    
    <P>Even if a class has an accessor, it doesn't need a mutator. For example,
      if an employee object has a social security number and that number is
      never supposed to change, there is no point in providing a <TT>setSSN</TT>
      accessor. Just set it once in the constructor and rest assured it stays
      unchanged from then on.</P>
