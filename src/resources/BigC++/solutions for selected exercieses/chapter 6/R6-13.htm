    <P>Encapsulation prevents direct access to an object's data. For example,
      one cannot assign a new value to an object variable as in <TT>e.salary =
      25,000;</TT>. All access to the object data happens via the public
      interface, that is through mutator and accessor functions, like <TT>e.set_salary(25,000);
      </TT>.</P>
    
    <P>Encapsulation prevents accidental or undesired use of an object's data.
      For example, there may be dependencies within an object's data elements
      and a change of one data element value must force a change in another. For
      example, the Time class member function <TT>add_seconds(n)</TT> is safer
      to use than setting seconds to a value that might be outside the legal
      range 0...59.</P>
