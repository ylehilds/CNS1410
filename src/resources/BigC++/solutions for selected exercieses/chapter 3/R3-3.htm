    <P>A member function is a function of a class that is applied to an
      instance of that class, i.e. an object, using the dot notation. For
      example, the statement <TT>wakeup_time.add_seconds(10000);</TT> is an
      application of the member function <TT>add_seconds</TT> to the Time
      object called <TT>wakeup_time</TT>. Member functions are not allowed to
      be used by themselves, they must always be applied to an object. A
      nonmember function is not a member of any class, hence it has no implicit
      parameter. Nonmember functions are not applied to objects.</P>
