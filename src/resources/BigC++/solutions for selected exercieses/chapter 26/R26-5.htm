<P>
A proxy does not change an interface, and does not perform
the actual work necessary to provide a service.  Instead, it
augments a service by layering on an additional responsibility.
In this sense the auto_ptr is an example of a proxy, since
it adds the memory management services, but does not otherwise
change an interface.
