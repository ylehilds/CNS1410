In C++ you test the iterator against the end-of-collection iterator.
There are two major advantages of this technique. First, it matches
the behavior of ordinary pointers, which means that algorithms
can be defined that work with both iterators and pointers. Second, 
it makes it easy to define sub-collections of a collection. The
disadvantage is that there are now two objects that must be
manipulated (the starting and stopping iterator).  In the design
pattern solution everything is encapsulated within one object.
If the two objects are mismatched (say, from different collections),
then great havoc can ensue.
