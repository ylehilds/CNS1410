The major difference is in the location of that part of the
algorithm that is fixed, and that part of the algorithm that
differs. In the strategy pattern, the variable part of the 
algorithm is supplied by passing an algorithm object to 
the class that carries out a computation.
<p>
In the template method pattern, the variable part of the algorithm is
supplied in virtual functions of a class that derives from the class
that carries out the algorithm.
