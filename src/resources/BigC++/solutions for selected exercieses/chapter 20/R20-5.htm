Friendship overrides the normal protection rules provided using
the keywords private and protected.  A friend is allowed access to
all parts of a class, even if they are declared private. On the positive
side this allows individual classes are functions to interact closely
with a class without forcing data fields to have wider accessibility that
would otherwise be desired.  On the negative side it means to that
understand how a class is being used you need to examine more than
just the class itself, and all friends may potentially be making changes
to the internal state of an instance of the class.
