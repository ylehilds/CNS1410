To encapsulate means to place into a capsule, or container. In C++ it
means that data fields and member functions defined within
a class can be made accessible only to the class, using the keyword
private. This ensure that the only way such values can be manipulated
is from within the class. In a multiprogrammer team, it means that
other programmers (those not working on the class) cannot have
direct access to this information.
