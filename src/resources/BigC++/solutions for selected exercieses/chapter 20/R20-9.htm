It is not possible to add new features to an existing class to 
which you don't have source code. For example, you cannot add a 
new feature to the ostream class unless you have its source code. 
But anyone can add new features to any name space, simply by providing 
a namespace declaration. For example, you can add new features to 
the std namespace (even though it is not a good idea to do that, 
of course...)
