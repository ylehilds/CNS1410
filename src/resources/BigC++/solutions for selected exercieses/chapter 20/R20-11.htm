Name spaces were invented to avoid name collisions. Initials make 
poor namespace names because they can easily collide. 
For example, Henrietta J. Horstmann has the same initials hjh. 
<p>
hjh36_yahoo_com might be a good name space if Harry's email address 
is hjh36@yahoo.com because email addresses are unique.
