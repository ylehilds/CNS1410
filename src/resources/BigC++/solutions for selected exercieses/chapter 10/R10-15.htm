Generally, returning a new stringis more convenient, but it is impossible if you work with character arrays.<br><br>The strcat function does not check whether it exceeds the target array'scapacity. The strncat function can be used instead, but it is cumbersometo compute the maximum number of characters to copy, and even more cumbersometo deal with the 0 terminator. The + operator simply allocates a string ofthe correct size. <br></body></html>
