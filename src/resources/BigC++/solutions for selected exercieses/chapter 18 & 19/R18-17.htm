As the following program will illustrate, the default assignment
will copy any pointer values. This could mean that the same
memory location would be deleted twice.  (And that anything
previously contained in a value that is target for an assignment
will not be deleted at all).

<pre>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
#include "trace.h"

using namespace std;

class Test {
public:
   Test(string n, int w);
   ~Test();
private:
   string name;
   int *p;
};

Test::Test(string n, int w) : name(n) 
{ 
   p = new int[1];
   *p = w;
}

Test::~Test()
{
   cout << "recovering memory for " << name <<"\n";
   cout << "value is " << *p << "\n";
   delete p;
}

int main() {
   Test a("a", 7);
   Test b("b", 9);
   b = a;
   return 0;
}
