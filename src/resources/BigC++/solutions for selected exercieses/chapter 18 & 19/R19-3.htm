The arguments for not handling exceptional conditions are usually
variations on (a) the exception will never arise in practice and/or
(b) it costs too much to check for this condition. What these arguments
ignore is that programmers are almost always poor at predicting
the unexpected, and nobody cares how fast your program will execute
if it does the wrong thing.
