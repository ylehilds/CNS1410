<BODY>
<P>
A binder sets one or more arguments for a function to a constant value,
leaving the remaining arguments as a new function. For example,
a binder might set one argument of a binary function, resulting
in a unary function. An example might be
<pre>
    bind2nd(less<int>(), 0)
</pre>
which is the "less than 0" function.
