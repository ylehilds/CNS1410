    <P>The get position is the position for the next read operation. The put
      position is the position for the next write operation.</P>
    
    <P>Normally the put position is at the end of the file, and the get
      position starts at the beginning of the file. <TT>fs.seekg(n, ios::beg);</TT>
      moves the get positions to character n counted from the beginning of the
      file fs, while <TT>fs.seekp(n, ios::beg);</TT> does the same for put.
    </P>
    
    <P>You can determine their current position with:</P>

<PRE>     long n = fs.tellg();
     or
     long n = fs.tellp();
				</PRE>
    
    <P>The number returned by the <TT>tellg()</TT> and <TT>tellp()</TT>
      functions is of type long because file sizes can be quite large, and an
      integer may not suffice to express a file position.</P>
