    <P>In a text file, numbers are stored as text. For example, the number 500
      is stored as characters <TT>'5' '0' '0'</TT>. In a binary file, numbers
      are stored as binary values. For example, the number 500 is stored as a
      sequence of four bytes with values <TT>0 0 1 244</TT>.</P>
