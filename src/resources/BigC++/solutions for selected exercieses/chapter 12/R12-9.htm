    <P>The command line is the string that a user types into a console window
      to start a program. For example, if a program is started with the command</P>
    

<PRE>program1 argmnt1 argmnt2 argmnt3</PRE>
    
    <P>then the command line arguments are <TT>argmnt1</TT>, <TT>argmnt2</TT>
      and <TT>argmnt3</TT>. These strings are passed to the <TT>main</TT>
      function in the <TT>char* argv[] </TT>parameter, as arrays of characters.
      Therefore, they should be converted to C++ strings, before using them.
    </P>
    
    <P><TT>argv[0]</TT> always contains the name of the program, <TT>program1</TT>,
      and <TT>argv[1]</TT> would contain <TT>argmnt1</TT>, etc.</P>
