    <P>The call stack display in the debugger shows the order in which
      functions have been called during the execution of the program. In
      addition the call stack shows the parameter values that have been passed
      to the called functions. </P>
    
    <P>Typical uses: </P>
    
    <P>1. If the debugger stops at a breakpoint, the call stack tells you how
      you got there. </P>
    
    <P>2. If functions are being called recursively, then the call stack will
      show the recursive calls and any parameters passed. This is useful to see
      how far the recursion has progressed.</P>
