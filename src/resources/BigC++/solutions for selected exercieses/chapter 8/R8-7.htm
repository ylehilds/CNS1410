    <P>A program trace is a list of messages issued from appropriate points
      within a program. An example would be a message announcing that a function
      has been called or a message that the function is exiting. This list can
      tell you where the computer is spending all of its processing time in the
      program. A program trace is useful if all you need to know is one or two
      details such as whether a function is called or a whether a variable has
      been set. Because it is tedious to insert and remove the trace messages,
      and because all updates to the trace message require recompilation, trace
      messages are not useful for heavy-duty debugging. </P>
