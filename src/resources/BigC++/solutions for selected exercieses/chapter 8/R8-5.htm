    <P>When a programmer identifies a problem in a function but fails to fix it
      properly, the problem will likely give rise to other failures in future
      versions of the function. The result is a cycling between fixes and
      failures and more fixes and failures. This is usually an indication that
      the programmer did not fully understand the problem or mistook it for
      something else. In order to avoid this situation it is important that the
      programmer make an effort to fully understand each error and not blindly
      apply a quick fix to the problem.</P>
