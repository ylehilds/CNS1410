    <P>The debugger option &quot;Running until the current line&quot; means run
      the program from the start until the currently selected line in the
      program is reached.  A breakpoint on the other hand allows for greater
      flexibility in determining when to stop because you can have as many
      breakpoints as you want. A condition can be used at a breakpoint to test
      whether the program should stop or continue.  </P>
    
    <P>But you must clear a breakpoint when you are no longer interested in it.
      If you are sure you just want to go to the current line once, then &quot;run
      until the current line&quot; is more convenient.</P>
