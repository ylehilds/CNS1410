    <P>The &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; strategy is used to identify the
      location of a bug. Once you know you have a problem of some kind, you need
      to know where it is occurring before you can attempt to fix it. Run the
      program about half-way to find out if the bug occurred in the first or
      second half. Then cut the interval in which you located the bug in half
      again. Keep doing that until you homed into the function that is
      responsible for the bug.. </P>
