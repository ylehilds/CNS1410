    <P>An oracle is a function that provides reliable answers that are used to
      verify the results from a function being tested. Usually, the oracle is
      slower or has some other limitations. After all, if it worked just as well
      as the function being tested <I>and</I> it was known to be reliable, you
      would use the oracle function instead of writing a new one.</P>
