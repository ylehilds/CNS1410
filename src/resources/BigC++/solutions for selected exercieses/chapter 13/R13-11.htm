    <P>Every Volvo is a car, so it can make sense to have a class<TT>Volvo</TT>
      (the set of all Volvos) that inherits from the class <TT>Car</TT> (the
      set of all cars). </P>
    
    <P>As a car manufacturer, Volvo is an <I>object</I>, not a class. The &quot;has-a&quot;
      inheritance relationship is a relationship between <I>two classes</I>,
      not between an object and a class. Therefore, Volvo would not be a derived
      class from <TT>CarManufacturer</TT>, but an object belonging to that
      class.</P>
