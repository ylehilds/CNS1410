    <P>What advantages do lists have over vectors? What disadvantages do they
      have? </P>
    
    <P>You can rearrange the order of the elements more easily with lists than
      with vectors. With lists you can add or delete any element at any point in
      the list but with vectors, adding or removing elements in the middle
      forces you to move the other elements. One disadvantage of lists is that
      accessing a particular element requires pointer traversal from either end
      of the list or from the current position in the list. This could lead to
      delay problems especially if one is searching the list elements. Another
      disadvantage of using lists is the extra programming overhead required to
      maintain next and previous pointers to all the elements. Adding new list
      elements requires careful programming to ensure that the list pointers are
      all assigned correctly. </P>
