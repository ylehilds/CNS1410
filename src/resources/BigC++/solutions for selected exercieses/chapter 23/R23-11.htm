<P>
Both a map and a vector access values using a key.  In a vector the
key is an integer offset, which allows for very fast execution since
the elements are stored in adjacent locations in memory. Also they index
values need not be stored with the elements. For a map
they key can be any value, and must be stored along with the values.
