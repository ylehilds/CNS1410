O(1) - execution time is constant, the same regardless of
the number of items in the container.
<P>
O(n) - execution time dependends in a linear fashion on the number
of items in a container.
<P>
O(1)+ - execution time is usually constant, but not always guaranteed
to be so. However, in any sufficiently large number of operations the
average execution must be constant.
