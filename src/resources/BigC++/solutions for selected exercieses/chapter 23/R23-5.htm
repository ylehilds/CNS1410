<BODY>
<P>
Normally the capacity, that is, the size of the buffer, is less
than the vector size. In this case adding a new element is simply
a matter of assignment and changing the size value. But when the
size reaches the capacity a new and larger buffer must be allocated and 
all the current elements copied.  The copy operation takes time 
proportional to the size of the vector.
