Features common to all games include the idea of players, moves and a score,
and an image. 
In the code for Chapter 13, the class Player could be converted
into a more general class, with methods such as get_name and 
increment_score. This could then be specialized for the clock game
player.  Similarly the class Game could be generalized to read
players and play around, and the remaining code moved into more
specialized classes.
