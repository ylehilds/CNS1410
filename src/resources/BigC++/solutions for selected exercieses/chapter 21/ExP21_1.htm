There are many possibilities.
One hierarchy would define them all as means of transportation.
A horse could be a subclass, as could be the class "mechanical means
of transportation". An airplane and a boat would both be an example 
of the latter, as would "wheeled means of transportation". 
The latter would include bus, and automabile.  But there are many
other ways of organizing this information.
