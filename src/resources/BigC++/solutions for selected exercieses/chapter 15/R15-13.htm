    <P>At worst the binary search will require O(<EM>n </EM>log <EM>n</EM>)
      inspections of the array for all elements. But since that on average half
      of the elements of <STRONG>b</STRONG> need to be moved to insert a new
      element then the number of element visits is <EM>n</EM><SUP>2</SUP><EM>
      </EM>/ 2 or O(<EM>n</EM><SUP>2</SUP>), not as good as merge sort. </P>
