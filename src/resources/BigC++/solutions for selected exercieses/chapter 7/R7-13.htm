    <P>There are three loop types: <TT>while</TT>, <TT>for</TT>, <TT>do/while</TT>.
      The <TT>while</TT> is the most common; <TT>for</TT> loops are used when
      a value runs from a starting to an ending value with a constanct increment
      or decrement; <TT>do/while</TT> loops are appropriate when the loop
      statements are executed at least once.</P>
