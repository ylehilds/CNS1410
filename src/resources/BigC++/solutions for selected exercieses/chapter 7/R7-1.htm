    <P>In C++ <TT>if/else if /else</TT> statements are used to express a
      multiple alternative, in which exactly one from a mutually exclusive set
      of choices is selected to be executed. Nested <TT>if</TT> statements are
      used to express a selection from multiple alternatives when there are
      multiple conditions for each selection.</P>
