    <P>While integers cannot represent numbers as large or as small as can be
      done with floating point numbers, the difference between successive
      integers is a single step, that is 1. There are no values in between, so a
      test for quality will either succeed or fail. By comparison,
      floating-point numbers are only accurate to within about 14 digits, after
      which point they are rounded. For example, a test of two identical
      numbers, e.g. <TT>sqrt(r * r) == r</TT> can fail. The best that can be
      said is that two floating-point numbers are equivalent within a certain
      tolerance.</P>
    
    <P>To test if an integer equals ten use:</P>

<PRE>   int n;
   . . .
   if (n == 10) . . .
</PRE>
    
    <P>To test if a floating point number equals ten use:</P>

<PRE>   float x;
   . . .
   if(fabs(x - 10) / max(fabs(x), 10) &lt;= EPSILON ) . . .
