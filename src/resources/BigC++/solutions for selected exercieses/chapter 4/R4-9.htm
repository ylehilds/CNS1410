    <P>To fix this problem takes more than just clearing the failed state--one
      would also have to read all bad input. The strategy in the book--to read
      the input with <TT>getline</TT>--is a better method for writing robust
      programs. Moral: Don't trust books that are written by people who don't
      code themselves.</P>
