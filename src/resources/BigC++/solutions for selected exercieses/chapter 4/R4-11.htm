    <P>An &quot;off by one&quot; error is a miscalculation of an integer
      variable that is off by 1 or another small amount. An example of this
      problem is illustrated as follows: </P>

<PRE>/*  Prompt for a word and display the number of times the letter 'a' 
     appears in the word
*/
string s;
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter a word&quot;;
cin &gt;&gt; s;
int len = s.length();
int count_a = 0;
int i = 1;
while (i &lt; len)
{
   if (s.substr(i,1) == &quot;a&quot;) 
    count_a++;
   i++;
}
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Letter a was found &quot; &lt;&lt; count_a &lt;&lt; &quot; times.\n&quot;;
</PRE>
    
    <P>The above code has a problem. The loop doesn't check each letter in the
      word. The first letter is skipped because the loop counter <TT>i</TT> is
      set to 1, instead of 0. </P>
