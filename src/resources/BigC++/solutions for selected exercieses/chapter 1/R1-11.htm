    <P>The advantage of using C++ is that it is the premier programming
      language of the day based on its widely used predecessor, C.  Many
      programs originally developed in C are easily supported by C++.  In
      addition C++ supports object-oriented features.  One of the drawbacks of
      C++ is that the language is not easy to master and it does have its share
      of pitfalls.  Also since C++ (and C) grew incrementally, various features
      of the language are somewhat patchwork and not intuitive.  </P>
