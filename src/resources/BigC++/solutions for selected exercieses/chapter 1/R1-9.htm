    <P>
      Higher level programming languages allow the programmer to express the 
      idea behind the task. They are independent of the underlying machine 
      language representation, consequently more portable. Each processor type
      uses its own version of assembler code which will not be compatible with
      other processors.  For example, an assembler code program written for an
      Intel processor will not run on a Sparc or Motorola processor.  Higher
      level languages like C++ allow programs to be developed which can be
      compiled and run on different processors.  Also, higher level languages
      can perform tasks in fewer, less complicated steps than with assembler
      code.</P>
