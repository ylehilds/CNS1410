    <P> Syntax errors are discovered by compiling the program and noting  any
      problems displayed by the compiler.  The compiler will not translate the
      program into machine code until all the syntax errors have been corrected.
        The compiler will also attempt to report as many syntax errors as it can
      find.  
    </P> 
    
    <P> Logic errors are not readily obvious since the compiler will not detect
       them as it compiles the program.  These types of errors are discovered by
      carefully examining the output and testing the program.</P>
