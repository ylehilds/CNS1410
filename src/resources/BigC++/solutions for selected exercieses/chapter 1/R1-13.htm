    <P>
      Some characters, like the escape character <TT>\</TT>, also called
      'backslash&quot;  and the string delimiter <TT>&quot;</TT>, commonly
      called double-quote have a special  meaning in the context of strings. In
      order to display them literally, they must be preceded by a <TT>\</TT>.
      Any use of <TT>\</TT> that is not followed by a special  character has a
      non-literal interpretation. For example, <TT>\n</TT> prints a  newline,
      that is, it moves the position of the cursor to the next line. The tab
      character is expressed as <TT>\t</TT>.  The backslash itself can be
      expressed as <TT>\\</TT>.
