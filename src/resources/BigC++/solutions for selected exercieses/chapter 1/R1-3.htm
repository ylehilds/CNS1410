    <P>Both primary storage (RAM and ROM) and Secondary storage (hard and
      floppy disk drives, Removable drives, CD-ROM and data tape) can store
      program code.</P>
    
    <P>Any primary or secondary storage except those that are read-only can
      store data.  Typically user data is stored in RAM, or on the hard disk, or
      on a floppy disk.  Since RAM is temporary storage while the PC has power,
      the hard disk or floppy disk is used to store a permanent copy of the user
      data.  </P>
