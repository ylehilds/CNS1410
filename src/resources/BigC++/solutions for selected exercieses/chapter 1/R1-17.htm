    <P>Yes, if the interest earned is greater than or equal to the withdrawn
      amount the balance will never reach zero. For example, a monthly interest
      rate of  5 percent on $10,000 equals the $500 withdrawal, so every month
      the balance will remain $10,000.

	Step 1.	Prompt for an balance value, rate value, and withdraw amount value.

	Step 2.	Start with the table

			After month	Balance
			0		balance value
	
 Step 3. If the balance value times the rate value / 12 / 100 is greater than the withdrawal amount, report that the account will never be depleted and quit.

	Step 4.	Repeat steps 4a,..4c while  balance value is greater than 0 and balance value times rate value is greater than withdraw amount value.
		Step 4a.	Add a new row to the table.
		Step 4b.	In column 1 of the new row, put one more than 
				the preceding month value.
		Step 4c.	In column 2 of the new row, place the value of the
				preceding balance value, multiplied by rate value / 12 / 100, then
				subtract withdraw amount.

	Step 3.	Divide the last number in the month column by 12, and report it as the 
		number of years required to deplete the account.
