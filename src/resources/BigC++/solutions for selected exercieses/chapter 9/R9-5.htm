    <P>An array index, or subscript, is an integer value or variable which
      represents a position in an array. </P>
    
    <P>The bounds of an array are the highest and lowest value that an arrays
      index may meaningful have. In C++, the lowest array index is 0, and the
      highest is consequently 1 less than the size of the array.</P>
    
    <P>A bounds error occurs when either the minimum or maximum meaningful
      index value is exceeded in an attempted assignment or access of an array
      element. </P>
