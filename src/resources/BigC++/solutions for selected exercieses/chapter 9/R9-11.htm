    <P>Parallel vectors are two or more vectors of the same length in which
      corresponding elements are logically related. For example, a vector of
      student ID numbers and a corresponding vector of student scores.</P>
    
    <P>Since it is difficult to manage multiple vectors, programmers using them
      tend to make them into global variables. </P>
    
    <P>To avoid parallel vectors, find a concept that describes a single
      instance of the related elements and make it into a class having member
      data corresponding to the separate vectors. Then, make a single vector of
      the new class type. For example, instead of having a vector for student ID
      numbers and a vector for student scores, create a new class that
      encapsulates the two into one class.</P>
