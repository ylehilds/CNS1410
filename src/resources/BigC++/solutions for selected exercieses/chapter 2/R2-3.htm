    <P>The problem with the quadratic formula as stated is that the expression
      <TT>2 * a</TT> needs to be expressed as <TT>(2 * a)</TT>. Without the
      parentheses the expression will be evaluated incorrectly as <TT>(-b +
      sqrt(b * b - 4 * a * c)) / 2</TT> multiplied by <TT>a</TT>. </P>
