Becoming familiar with your computer</H4><P>All modern computers offer their users an interface to their physical, electrical, and digital systems. Yourcomputer's <I>operating system</I> provides fundamental services from behind the scenes. A large part of a computer'swork is simply storing and retrieving <I>data</I> so that it can be available to use.</P><P>Put simply, the operating system takes care of a lot of the filing work - storing, moving and remembering wherethings are - so you can do useful things at a higher level. You interact with the operating system via a <I>GraphicUser Interface (GUI)</I>, for example a windowing system using a pointing device like a mouse, or a <I>CommandLine Interface</I>, using only a keyboard and a single window.</P><P>What are some examples of tasks you'd tell the computer to do via the Operating System interface?</P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_R1a" ROWS="8" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA></P><P>Operations like browsing the web and editing text in a word processor - most of the things you'd have the computerdo - involve your operating system executing some <I>program</I>. The Operating System itself is a program whichis running all the time. It executes your instructions and, in turn, it can run other programs.</P><P>It is useful to think of a program as a sequence of instructions. Both executable instructions and digital datacan be represented as files, for example, on your hard drive. Both are sequences of symbols, just like the lettersthat make up the words in this sentence. Your job as a programmer is of course to provide the instructions thatoperate on the data.</P><P>We will begin to get some experience with the Operating System by finding a file.  We will locate math.h, aninclude file used by C++.  You may need to ask your instructor or a friend how to find a file on your computeras well as the location of the include files. </P><P>What did you do to find <TT>math.h?</TT></P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_R1b" ROWS="8" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA></P><P>How did you open math<TT>.h</TT> ?</P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_R1c" ROWS="8" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA></P><P>The program that you'll be running to write computer programs is your text editor, which often is part of anintegrated compiler environment. You may be working in a computer lab--then ask your lab guide how to start theeditor. Or you may have purchased and installed your own compiler. Then follow the vendors instructions. Go aheadand start it now.</P><P>Again, what did you do?</P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_R1d" ROWS="8" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA> <HR ALIGN="CENTER"><H4>R2. Compiling and running programs from within your development environment</H4><P>Frequently in these labs you will be asked to compile a sample program.

Writing simple programs</H4><P>Your initial C++ programs will be contained entirely in one file, and there are some elements that they allwill have because of requirements of the C++ language. Essentially, these are 1) markers for the compiler - toknow where your program begins and ends - and 2) files that your program also needs in order to operate. When youbuild a program, your compiler looks for code of the form:</P><PRE>#include &lt;iostream&gt;using namespace std;int main(){   /*      your work goes here   */      return 0;}   </PRE><P>The textbook has a program that prints the message <TT>Hello, World!</TT> on the screen.</P><P>Try changing it to display <TT>Hello, Universe!</TT></P><P>Type the program into your compiler's editor, compile and test. Then paste the source code in the followingtext box.</P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_P1a" ROWS="20" COLS="80">/* paste program here */</TEXTAREA> <HR ALIGN="CENTER"><H4>P2. Detecting syntax and logic errors</H4><P>There are numerous opportunities for error in any program, many times in places that seem too simple to requireclose attention.

Algorithms</H4><P>An algorithm is a recipe to carry out a task. To be programmable, such a recipe must be</P><UL>	<LI>Unambiguous	<LI>Executable	<LI>Terminating</UL><P>While an algorithm will eventually be expressed in a particular programming language, it is frequently helpfulto describe its operation in natural language, before undertaking the task of coding it up.Suppose for example that you would like to calculate your future salary, knowingthat you will receive a 3% raise every year.&nbsp; If you made $20,000 thisyear, your salary next year would be $20,600 ($20,000 + ($20,000)*.03)) and$21,218 the year after ($20,600 + ($20,600 * .03)), $21,854.54 the year after($21,218 + ($21,218 * .03)), etc.</P><P>Describe an algorithm to do this computation for a salary of $30000 after anynumber of years. Your algorithm should be so detailed that anyone can carry out the steps and arrive at the correct answer.</P><P><TEXTAREA NAME="CCC_CH1_R3a" ROWS="20" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA> <HR ALIGN="CENTER"><h4>P3. Additional Programming Practice</h4><P>&nbsp;Often times, you will find that a program can be written by modifyinganother program that you have written before. The calculation which we justwrote the algorithm for can be generalized as follows:<P>&nbsp;<blockquote>  <b>P = C (1 + r)<sup>t&nbsp;</sup></b></blockquote>  <p>Where P is the final pay rate, C is the starting pay rate, r is the percentincrease (expressed as a decimal) and t is the number of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for example, to compute  your salary after 5 years, starting at $20000 with 3% increases per year we  would get:  <p>&nbsp;<blockquote>P = 20000(1+.03)<sup>5&nbsp; </sup>=&nbsp; 23185.48&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Modify the&nbsp;program that you fixed in section P2 to calculate your payafter being with a company for 10 years.&nbsp; Assume that you had started witha salary of $18,000 and that you receive a 3% raise every year. having startedwith a salary of $18,000.&nbsp; Paste your program here:<p><TEXTAREA NAME="S1" ROWS="15" COLS="80">/* paste program here */</TEXTAREA> <p>Now, compile it and execute it.&nbsp; Paste your output in the space below:<p><TEXTAREA NAME="S2" ROWS="2" COLS="80"></TEXTAREA> <P>Don't forget to <A HREF="#submit">send your answers</A> when you're finished.</FORM></BODY></HTML>
